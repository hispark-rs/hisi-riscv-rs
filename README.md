# ws63-rs

A Rust embedded ecosystem for the **HiSilicon WS63** — a single-core RISC-V
(RV32IMFC, hard-float `ilp32f`, no atomics) Wi-Fi 6 + BLE + SLE/SparkLink SoC.

This monorepo bundles a `svd2rust` peripheral-access crate, a hand-written safe
HAL, a runtime, a porting layer for the closed-source Wi-Fi/BLE blobs, and
runnable examples — buildable today with a custom Rust toolchain, and runnable
**without hardware** on the sister project [`ws63-qemu`](https://github.com/sanchuanhehe/ws63-qemu).

> **North star: connectivity.** Everything here is aimed at eventually bringing
> up Wi-Fi/BLE on the WS63 in Rust. See [`ROADMAP.md`](ROADMAP.md) for the staged
> plan and [`docs/`](docs/) for the architecture (Chinese).

## Crates

Each library crate is a standalone repository (a git submodule here) and is
published independently to crates.io; `ws63-rf-rs` and `ws63-flashboot` live
in-tree and are not published.

| Crate | Role | crates.io |
|-------|------|-----------|
| [`ws63-pac`](ws63-pac/) | `svd2rust`-generated peripheral access (raw `RegisterBlock`s, `Peripherals::take()`) | [`ws63-pac`](https://crates.io/crates/ws63-pac) |
| [`ws63-hal`](ws63-hal/) | Hand-written safe drivers on `embedded-hal 1.0` (GPIO, UART, SPI, I2C, DMA, timers, clocks, …) | [`ws63-hal`](https://crates.io/crates/ws63-hal) |
| [`ws63-rt`](ws63-rt/) | Runtime: startup assembly, linker scripts, interrupt vectors (over `riscv-rt`) | [`ws63-rt`](https://crates.io/crates/ws63-rt) |
| [`ws63-rf-rs`](ws63-rf-rs/) | Porting layer + FFI for the closed Wi-Fi/BLE blobs (OSAL/OAL/FRW/HCC, scheduler, netif→smoltcp). In-tree, `publish = false` | — |
| [`ws63-flashboot`](ws63-flashboot/) | Experimental bootloader (**not** secure boot). In-tree, `publish = false` | — |
| [`ws63-examples`](ws63-examples/) | Runnable examples (blinky, uart_hello, timer_irq, gpio_irq, dma_loopback, …) | — |

## Repository layout

The repo uses git submodules extensively. Two are **nested under the crate that
owns them**, so generation inputs / vendor blobs are not reached into laterally:

```
ws63-rs/
├── ws63-pac/            # submodule
│   └── ws63-svd/        # submodule of ws63-pac — the svd2rust source (WS63.svd)
├── ws63-hal/            # submodule
├── ws63-rt/             # submodule
├── ws63-rf-rs/          # in-tree crate
│   └── ws63-RF/         # submodule — closed Wi-Fi/BLE blobs + porting contract
├── ws63-flashboot/      # in-tree crate
├── ws63-examples/       # submodule
├── ws63-guide/          # submodule — user guide
├── docs/                # architecture docs (Chinese) + review ledger
├── CLAUDE.md            # build/architecture guide
└── ROADMAP.md           # staged plan toward connectivity
```

Always clone/update with recursion:

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

## Getting started

### 1. Install the `ws63` toolchain

The default target `riscv32imfc-unknown-none-elf` (hardware single-float
`ilp32f`, no atomics) is **baked into a custom rustc** as a builtin, so no
`-Z build-std` is needed. It is not a distributable rustup channel — install +
link it first (see [`rust-toolchain.toml`](rust-toolchain.toml) and the
[ws63-rust-toolchain](https://github.com/sanchuanhehe/ws63-rust-toolchain) repo):

```bash
curl -fLO https://github.com/sanchuanhehe/ws63-rust-toolchain/releases/download/v1.96.0/ws63-rust-1.96.0-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz
tar xzf ws63-rust-1.96.0-*.tar.gz && rustup toolchain link ws63 "$PWD/stage2"
```

### 2. Build

```bash
cargo build                  # libraries + the default-member examples
cargo check --workspace      # full workspace (incl. flashboot)
cargo build -p blinky --release
```

Lint / format:

```bash
cargo clippy --workspace
cargo fmt --all -- --check
```

## Run without hardware (software-in-the-loop)

[`ws63-qemu`](https://github.com/sanchuanhehe/ws63-qemu) is a QEMU fork with an
in-tree WS63 machine (`-M ws63`) that models the CPU + xlinx custom ISA, memory
map, interrupt controller, and all 35 SVD peripherals. It runs ws63-rs firmware
(and real vendor C-SDK firmware) and is the software-in-the-loop stand-in for
ROADMAP phase 1 "hardware bring-up":

```bash
# in a sibling checkout of ws63-qemu
bash scripts/build.sh
WS63_RS=../ws63-rs bash scripts/smoke-test.sh   # boots ws63-rs examples + asserts behaviour
```

## Releasing

Each published crate **self-publishes from its own repository**: bump + tag
`vX.Y.Z` in `ws63-pac` / `ws63-hal` / `ws63-rt`, and that repo's
`.github/workflows/release.yml` publishes it to crates.io (using its own
`CRATES_IO_TOKEN`). The monorepo `v*` tag cuts only a **firmware GitHub
Release** — it does not publish the library crates.

## Documentation

- [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md) — build commands, architecture, design decisions.
- [`docs/architecture/overview.md`](docs/architecture/overview.md) — the whole picture (Chinese), with per-component docs alongside.
- [`docs/review/`](docs/review/) — the architecture review ledger.
- [`ROADMAP.md`](ROADMAP.md) — remediation plan and the path to connectivity.

## License

MIT for the Rust code (see each crate's `Cargo.toml`). The closed-source vendor
blobs under `ws63-rf-rs/ws63-RF` carry HiSilicon's own license and are **not**
MIT — that delivery stays language-neutral and is only linked, never modified.
